IN CSS:

Will handle all the margins/paddings/texts/images/colors/fonts etc

add the style for the cards (shape,image etc.)
add the cards being able to show a back side and front side (Add a flip)
add background
add TWO buttons: One button to start the game --> Will start a 20 sec timer. Second button the initiate play again.
Add title along first button (either above or next to it, will see which one looks more appealing)
Add cards that do match to stay flipped on the correct side (to prevent from clicking again)
Add a "Congratulation text upon winning" 


BONUS: Add randomizer of cards for every time they click Button 1 OR button 2 to either start game or play again. That way the cards are not in the same position.
Think about how to maybe initiate Button 1 & 2 together so you dont need 2 buttons.


IN JS:

This where all the code goes.

Gonna need eventlisteners for everytime the user clicks on a card, wrong or right, (else if statements)
Gonna need eventlisteners for buttons as well.
Gonna need to link a timer to button.
Gonna need to link the cards to be all shown for 20 seconds when the button starts (Play again/Play button)

*(Developer note: We probably want just one button. Figure it out!)*

Gonna need Declare Winner when game done
Gonna need to establish the play again


BONUS: Make cards randomized order every time they click Play again (This way it prevents them from being "Stale" same position)



IN INDEX:

This is where we label everything we want to add
Our "board", our cards, our button name, etc
